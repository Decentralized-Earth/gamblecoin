# Gamblecoin Blockchain

Gamblecoin - A new fork of Litecoin with random bonus blocks and super Blocks. Like Litecoin it uses scrypt as a proof of work scheme.

   - 1 min block target
   - Difficulty retargets every 5 min with accelerated diff adjustment in the beginning
   - Initially 950 coins per block, halves every 10 months (500,000 blocks)
   - Total around 21 billion coins
   - connection port is 24542, RPC-port 24543


Random Super-blocks for the 1st 500000 blocks (10 months)

    
    - 5% chances 950 GCA/block
    - 1% chances 9500 GCA/block
    - 0.01% chances 95000 GCA/block (so expect 50 such blocks)


After 500000 blocks

    - 5% chances 2 times the current GCA reward (i.e. if current is 475 GCA, you get 950 GCA)
    - 1% chances 5 times the current GCA reward
    - 0.01% chance 58 times the current GCA reward
